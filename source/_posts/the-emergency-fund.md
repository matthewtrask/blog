A tweet was surfaced today where someone mentioned being sick and a freelancer. As someone who hates working on contracts for this reason, it was still a fresh reminder of what I am currently going through.. funemployment. The topic of needing an emergency fund came up, but was immediately met with responses saying they weren't sure if it was possible to create one. I'm here to say it abso-fucking-lutely is, and I want to offer some tips. 

### What is an emergency fund?

At it's core, the emergency fund is there for emergencies. For this, _you_ have to define what is an emergency. My definition is any expense I can't reasonable cover out of pocket. Things like car repairs usually fall into this lot. Medical bills for sure, even though I do have health insurance, we all know in America that the system is designed to work against us.
