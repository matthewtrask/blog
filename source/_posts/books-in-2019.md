As a kid I was a huge reader. I had so many books that I had multiple book cases in my room. One of them was built into the headboard of my bed, so I didn't have to get out of bed to get a book. I read things like "The Boxcar Children" to "Goosebumps" to anything I could find on the RMS Titanic. As I grew, my fascination with history grew and I read everything I could around the American Revolution up to World War 2. Sadly though, when high school made me read through certain books my interest in reading waned. This was around the time we got the internet, so I read web pages instead of books.

This year, when I was talking to my boss at my old job, he mentioned a few books he really enjoyed on Audible. I had heard of Audible but never got into it. On his recommendation, I grabbed one book and I was hooked. It was as if a spark was reignited in me. I went out to a book store soon after and bought books both old and new. I hope this type of post becomes a tradition for as long as I blog. 

Without further ado, here is what I read and listened to in 2019. 

<small>All the books will a link to buy them in book/audio form, however none of the links are ref links. I do not make any money if you choose to buy one.</small>

### Paper Books

##### Financial
* <a href="hhttps://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-Original-1926/dp/1508524351/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3USNBOAJGN9S9&keywords=richest+man+in+babylon+book&qid=1576851083&s=books&sprefix=ricehest+%2Cstripbooks%2C165&sr=1-3">"The Richest Man In Babylon"</a> by George Clason.

One of my favorites, JL Collins breaks down the notion that investing is hard, and examines the most tried and true way to growing wealth: index funds. <small>(Note: Index Funds are a moral quandry to deal with, because the main on JL talks about, VTSAX, has every single stock on the NYSE in it... private prisons and all.)</small>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Financial-Independence-Retire-Early/dp/1608685802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=playing+with+fire&qid=1576851240&s=books&sr=1-1">"Playing With Fire"</a> by Scott Rieckens (also a movie!)

A lot of FIRE books cover the how, but this is a personal story of the why. With cameos of popular FIRE bloggers, this is a nice tale and gives you a lot to think about.

After reading this, I couldn't stop thinking about my life in dollars. Every single action has a dollar amount correlation, and they explore it in this book.

##### Inspirational

This was recommended to me by a guy I met who was in town doing some AWS consulting. I couldn't put it down. It's now something we make product owners and software team leaders at work read.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving/dp/1942788762">The Unicorn Project</a> by Gene Kim (Still reading this.)

<hr>$$

There may be more but this seems to be a very good list based on what I read and listened too. As I mentioned above, each is a link to Amazon for you to buy any of these books. I highly recommend them all. 

If you are trying to avoid amazon or want to buy used, <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com">this</a> looks like a wonderful serrvice. I plan on using them a lot in 2020. 

What did you read this year?
