It wasn't in my plans to be a keynoter this year, or ever, but here we are. Im happy to say I will be one of the keynote speakers of
[MidwestPHP](https://midwestphp.org), my talk being about mental health and how I've learned to adapt and overcome challenges. Hopefully
people will leave this talk with some ideas they can adapt to their lives as well. Based on a thread from Phil Sturgeon, depression can strike
anyone at anytime no matter who you are. Very timely. 

Also, Im happy to say I will be giving a session at Midwest PHP going over the OpenAPI and how you can build your APIs with it. Its a fun talk and I love
giving it. Before that though, I will be in Miami to speak about Vue.js at [Sunshine](https://sunshinephp.com). Why I submitted on JS I dont know, but
Im having fun with it. Im recycling the API I built for CascadiaPHP to build a front end with Vue, which gives me more material for Midwest as well.

Im sure I will end up at other conferences but so far these are sure fire things. Other things I hope to accomplish soon: 

* Launch the new PHPVersions. It will be built on PHP instead of Jekyll. Im hoping to take better advantage of automation and APIs to make this project 
more robust. I also plan on publishing an OpenAPI spec to go along with it so others can consume the data. 
* Launch a personal finance blog. It's no secret I've been trying to learn everything I can about about personal finance and investing, both things 
I wasn't taught much about in school or my early life. I hope this project helps others, especially developers making an insane amount of money make 
smart choices. 
* Launch a photography blog. My last little project will be a photography blog. I got a camera this year and it's been a lot of fun going downtown to take pictures. 
It would be great to see if I can turn it into a side business but right now its just fun. 

Hope to see you around at a conference next year!
