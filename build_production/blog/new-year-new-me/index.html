        <p>What can you challenge yourself with to be the best you? Here are mine.</p>
<h3>A photograph a day.</h3>
<p>In my &quot;year in review&quot; post I mentioned I got into photography. For 2019 one thing I want to do is take a picture a day. There are a few things I hope to achieve with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I hope to get better at composition and framing. </li>
<li>I hope it challenges me to explore more. </li>
<li>Give me a portfolio of stuff to hopefully sell/create monetary options.</li>
</ol>
<p>To follow along, check out my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/164111164@N05/">flickr</a>. I hope to move all the content to my own site soon. Just gotta buid it.</p>
<h3>Read 52 Books</h3>
<p>I used to be a huge reader. I would crush a series of books in no time as a kid. I have sadly fallen off in recent years, so I hope to pick that back up. The first three books of the new year are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Jurassic Park (holy shit so good)</li>
<li>Into The Wild</li>
<li>Simple Path to Wealth</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no real method to the madness here. I picked up Jurassic Park cause it caught my eye. As for Into The Wild, I loved Jon Krakauer's recount of the 1996 Everest Diaster in Into Thin Air, so I hope
this will be a good read. Simple Path To Wealth is a book I've heard references on countless FI/RE podcasts and interviews. I love JL Collin's style of discussion. Even keeled, soft spoken but authoritative
in the realm of wealth and investment, I think this will be a game changer. </p>

<h3>Two new blogs</h3>
<p>As I referenced above, I want to move my photographs to my own content management system for a few reasons. Mainly I want to control how it is shown,
and should something happen to flickr, I don't want to scramble to get my images. </p>
<p>The other blog will be a personal finance blog aimed at developers. I've tweeted about it a few times and the response is always &quot;yes please&quot;. As I read a lot of 2018 review blog posts, one thing mentioned
was getting the finances in order but very few people know where to start. I hope the aim of my blog will be a mix of good foundational starting points as well as more advanced
topics like FI/RE, investing, real estate and more. </p>
<p>Look for these, I will be tweeting and posting about them as they get close to be done.</p>
<h3>Walk more</h3>
<p>I live in a great area of Nashville. There is a coffee shop .5 miles away, a brewery .3 miles away and an excellent sandwich shop .5 miles away in the opposite direction. There is no reason
for me to drive other than I want to waste resources. So a challenge of mine is to walk more, be more in the community I am apart of and enjoy it. A side effect is hopefully some weight loss. </p>
<h3>Weight loss</h3>
<p>I've struggled for years to lose weight, or rather be motivated to lose weight. I am not getting younger, but I have plenty of time to enjoy life and feel better. I am to do this through better eating,
less garbage like soda, more walking, more cycling, and maybe running. Maybe.</p>
<h3>Remove the last of my debts</h3>
<p>I have two loans right now. A student loan at $6,000-ish dollars and a personal loan for $8,000-ish dollars. These suck! It's a weight just hanging over you. I want them gone, so they will be.
I've spent the morning running numbers and preparing myself for a financially healthy 2019. These should pave the way for my net worth to grow, and free up money to pump into stocks like VTSAX. </p>
<p>I aim to talk more in depth about all this on the financial blog I mentioned earlier. </p>
<h3>Loose ends</h3>
<p>I think this covers it. I am working on being happier, more confident and more at peace with life. 2018 was a struggle at times for various reasons. I gained weight, destroyed some relationships (dating and not dating),
and basically was just down on myself the whole time. I am a good developer (sometimes), and I have things to offer but I can't offer them if I am not at my best. </p>
<p>So 2019, come at me. It'll be fun.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>    </div>
